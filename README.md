# Ansible AWS Greengrass

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vmware/ansible-aws-greengrass.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vmware/ansible-aws-greengrass)

This is an Ansible repo to set up the server side features for an AWS
Greengrass project and deploy the IoT portions that would run in a data
center.  

## Overview

This project includes the following abilities:

* Create roles and policies necessary to run Greengrass and interact with
devices
* Generate Greengrass Groups and Cores identities at AWS
* Generate automatic devices and associated certificates necessary for
communication
* Deploy lambda functions and associate them with Greengrass Groups
* Install and configure Greengrass Cores at the target runtime location
* Deploy configuration versions to Greengrass Cores to start and upgrade their
operation

## Try it out

1. Deploy a host for the controller (this might be your development box.)
2. Connect to the controller and perform remaining steps there
3. Install Ansible (http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/)
    * Quick steps for ubuntu 14.04, as an example:
        1. `sudo apt-get install -y python-pip python-dev libssl-dev sshpass`
        1. `sudo pip install --upgrade setuptools`
        1. `sudo pip install ansible markupsafe jmespath`
4. Clone this repository and cd into it
5. Configure hosts (check values in the inventory file, e.g. ```cp inventory.sample inventory``` and edit)
6. Copy `extra_vars.yml.sample` to `extra_vars.yml`, and customize as necessary.
7. Set password and other security (optional)
   ```
   echo "$VAULT_PASSWORD" > vault_password
   # For example, AWS keys...
   ansible-vault encrypt_string --vault-id vmware@vault_password 'access-key' --name aws_access_key
   ansible-vault encrypt_string --vault-id vmware@vault_password 'secret-key' --name aws_secret_key
   # and paste the output into extra_vars
   ```
   Also ensure you have credentials or keys for ssh to all target servers.
   NOTE: You can also manually enter the vault password during execution with ```--vault-id vmware@prompt```
8. You may wish to first run the `awscli` role targeting your development box
(e.g. localhost) and perform later steps from there.
   ```
   ansible-playbook site.yml -i inventory --vault-id vmware@vault_password --extra-vars "@extra_vars.yml" -kK --tags dev
   ```
9. Run site playbook:
    ```
    ansible-playbook site.yml -i inventory --vault-id vmware@vault_password --extra-vars "@extra_vars.yml" -kK
    ```
    or
    ```
    ansible-playbook site.yml -i inventory --vault-id vmware@prompt --extra-vars "@extra_vars.yml" -kK
    ```

Running on OSX for development
------------------------------

To test basic provisioning on OSX, you have options.  You may wish to
run ansible on the OSX machine, targeting VMs launched via VMware
Fusion, VirtualBox, etc., or you can run a container (see below) on OSX for the
controller.

Local with Containers
---------------------

Installing docker is an exercise for the reader; follow best practices for your
platform.

Build the container:
```
docker build -t vmware/ansible-aws-greengrass .
```

Run the container interactively for debugging:
```
# Build a version with debug tools
docker build -t vmware/ansible-aws-greengrass:debug -f Dockerfile.debug .
# For debugging, run the container with VNC so you can debug ansible.
docker run -it -v $PWD:/code -p 5920:5920 --entrypoint /bin/bash vmware/ansible-aws-greengrass:debug /vnc/vnc.sh
# You can then connect with VNC to your docker host, port 5920 (display 20).
# Or alternatively, run no-vnc:
docker run -it -v $PWD:/code -p 6080:6080 --entrypoint /bin/bash vmware/ansible-aws-greengrass:debug /novnc/novnc.sh
# ...and then connect in a browser to your docker host, port 6080.
```

Run the container to perform ansible steps:
```
docker run -it -v $PWD:/code vmware/ansible-aws-greengrass
```

### Prerequisites

* You'll need Ansible (2.5+)
* Before first run, you'll need AWS credentials with at least IAM, IoT, and
Greengrass permissions, and most likely with S3 read/write
* You must ensure the current Greengrass Core distribution is available on S3
(at the time of this writing, greengrass-linux-x86-64-1.3.0.tar.gz), or host it
at some URL and supply that by setting the appropriate variable.
* AWS Greengrass Core role currently only supports Ubuntu; you'll need an
Ubuntu VM or machine, or be prepared to port.
* This role uses the json_query filter which requires jmespath on the local
machine.

### Build & Run

You can, of course, run the entire playbook to completion, which will deploy all
configured parts of Greengrass.  For a first run, it's simpler to break up into
multiple steps to verify correct configuration.

The typical end-to-end process is as follows.

1. Configure machine inventory and extra_vars for your environment.
2. Run Ansible with the dev tag to set up the host machine.
```
ansible-playbook site.yml -i inventory --extra-vars "@extra_vars.yml" -kK --tags dev
```
3. Connect to that host machine and then run Ansible with the greengrass-init
tag to make AWS console changes and setup the basic IoT items.
```
ansible-playbook site.yml -i inventory --extra-vars "@extra_vars.yml" -kK --tags greengrass-init
```
4. Run Ansible with the lambda-deploy tag to deploy lambda functions to AWS.
(Only if Lambdas are intended to run at Greengrass Cores)
```
ansible-playbook site.yml -i inventory --extra-vars "@extra_vars.yml" -kK --tags greengrass-init
```
5. Run Ansible with the greengrass-core tag to deploy
and configure the greengrass cores.
```
ansible-playbook site.yml -i inventory --extra-vars "@extra_vars.yml" -kK --tags greengrass-core
```
6. Run Ansible with the greengrass-deploy tag to deploy a version of the runtime
configuration and start IoT processing.
```
ansible-playbook site.yml -i inventory --extra-vars "@extra_vars.yml" -kK --tags greengrass-deploy
```

## Documentation

See code files for further documentation.  The ```extra_vars.yml.sample``` file
has sample settings for customization for your environment.
